# Data Analysis with Python (pandas) - PyCitySchools

Module 4 Challenge - PyCitySchools

Used imports and paths to join the csv file into the new file in Jupyter Notebook.

Used read to get the data from the two csv files as well as a pd.merge to merge the data from both files into one large dataframe.

Calculated the number of unique schools, the number of students, the overall budget for each school,
the average scores for both reading and math, as well as the passing percentages for those two subjects,
and then calculated the overall passing rate using both of those scores to find the passing rate for both.

Also using pandas, was able to pull the individual information for school names, types, number of students,
as well as the school budgets, and the budgets broken down by per student.
Calculated the same scores as before (math, reading, percent passing, overall passing), but for each individual school.

Using this information from the dataframes, scores could be found for each grade 9th-12th,
as well as which schools performed highest and lowest respectively using their overall passing percentages.

School spending was also calculated and used as a metric against the overall passing rates for each individual school.

To complete this challenge, I referenced the resources provided to us during class time,
the notes provided to us in the starter file as a guide,
as well as the supplimental content provided by the instructor.
